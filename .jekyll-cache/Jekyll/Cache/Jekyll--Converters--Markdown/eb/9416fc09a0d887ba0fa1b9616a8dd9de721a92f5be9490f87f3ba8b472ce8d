<h2>Pre-Race</h2>

<p><span class="time">6:45 a.m. </span><br />
It’s the morning of my first triathlon, and light has started to shine onto the verdant hills surrounding Lake Berryessa. I’m at the trunk of Christine’s car, filling my water bottle and tweaking my bike. </p>

<p>Where are my goggles? Under the bike. Where is my helmet? Not on my head. The only thing I can find are my nerves. They’re right where I left them — on the brink of bursting. </p>

<p><span class="time">6:53 a.m. </span><br />
At the race site, I see a cluster of bright orange swim caps by the banks of the lake. They belong to the Sprint athletes, who will be starting soon. The water before them looks cold and uninviting, the sky above us all grey and unfriendly.</p>

<p><span class="time">6:58 a.m. </span><br />
Eager as they are to spill over, my nerves are stifled by the demands of pre-race setup. In the transition area, a loudspeaker reminds us to be out in 5 minutes, so I organize my area without the benefit of rhyme, reason, or experience. I place my running shorts on top of my running shoes. Two and a half hours later, they’ll be soaked. </p>

<p><span class="time">7:15 a.m. </span><br />
Lights, camera, wetsuits.</p>

<p><img class="ver-image" src="/assets/img/hits/wetsuit.jpg" /></p>

<p><span class="time">7:34 a.m. </span><br />
Sobir and I head towards Lake Berryessa. The sharp gravel cuts at my bare feet. We’re surrounded by other athletes competing in the Olympic distance, and I feel the excitement and anticipation buzzing through the crowd. Suddenly, someone announces: “First Wave, starting in 1 minute!” </p>

<p>“Oh shit, that’s us!”</p>

<h2 id="swim">Swim</h2>

<p><span class="time">7:39 a.m. </span><br />
The gun fires. All around me, people plunge in. A wave, the result of hundreds of frenzied strokes, disturbs the lake’s otherwise placid surface. I dive in. To my surprise, the water is warm. </p>

<p>I immediately feel the timing chip on my upper ankle slipping. I try to stand up to put it back on, but the water is already too deep. I swim back to the shore instead, where I tighten it, take a deep breath, and head back out. </p>

<p><span class="time">7:42 a.m. </span><br />
It hasn’t landed that I’m actually in the water. I take a few strokes, and stop. Take a few strokes, and stop. Breathing is harder than usual. I can’t find a rhythm. My discomfort must have been apparent, because someone asks if I’m ok. </p>

<p>Yes, I answer — I know from training that the start is always the toughest. </p>

<p><span class="time">7:46 a.m. </span><br />
The swim course consists of 4 buoys arranged in a diamond. We swim two laps for 1500 meters. By now, I’ve inched myself to the first buoy. </p>

<p>I’m surrounded by other swimmers. Most of them are going strong, but a few are still stopping and starting frequently, like me. Their existence is encouraging. </p>

<p><span class="time">7:50 a.m. </span><br />
I’ve settled down a bit. Even so, only one thought runs through my head: get me out of the water, and onto my bike. </p>

<p><span class="time">7:54 a.m. </span><br />
The toughest part about open water swimming is knowing where I am. I don’t always know if I’m headed towards the next buoy, or if I’m veering off to the side. I don’t know if my arm will cut through the water, or if it will smack the body of a nearby swimmer. </p>

<p><span class="time">8:07 a.m. </span><br />
Just keep swimming, just keeping swimming, just keep swimming, swimming, swimming.</p>

<p><span class="time">8:11 a.m. </span><br />
Buoy 6 reached. I’ll be at buoy 7 soon. </p>

<p><span class="time">8:14 a.m. </span><br />
Weird, buoy 7 doesn’t seem to be getting closer.</p>

<p><span class="time">8:22 a.m. </span><br />
Finally, I reach the shore. The crowd offers their support as I run uphill towards the transition area. Midway up, I see Christine, with a beaming smile and her cellphone pointed in my direction.</p>

<h2 id="t1">Transition 1: Swim to Bike</h2>
<p><span class="time">8:25 a.m. </span><br />
I’ve shed my wetsuit, goggles, and swim cap. I try changing out of the compression shorts that I wore under my wetsuit, but my towel doesn’t provide enough security. I try the Porta-Potty, but the ground is filthy and my shoes aren’t on. And I still have to put my contacts in. </p>

<h2 id="bike">Bike</h2>

<p><span class="time">8:31 a.m.</span><br />
After my fitful swim, the steady motion of my bike has never felt smoother.</p>

<p><span class="time">8:34 a.m. </span><br />
The bike course uses the same road that Christine and I drove on to arrive at the race site. It extends 6.2 miles; we ride out-and-back twice for a total of 24.8 miles.
Driving in her car, we don’t even notice the road’s climbs and descents. During the first climb of the day, I feel every inch.</p>

<p><span class="time">8:40 a.m. </span><br />
As finishing the triathlon is my only concern, I take it easy on the bike to conserve energy. Many bikers pass me, but the most serious triathletes are the most conspicuous. They have long legs, muscular calves, and aerodynamic helmets. “On your left!” they bellow, the wheels of their bikes churning like helicopter propellers as they power past.</p>

<p><span class="time">9:03 a.m. </span><br />
It’s been raining for the past 10 minutes. My shirt is soaked, and my hands are numb from the cold. The descents—hitherto the most enjoyable part of the ride — are no longer painless, as the wind and water blow past my body and rush into my eyes.</p>

<p><span class="time">9:12 a.m. </span><br />
Things seen during my ride: at least 10 discarded water bottles, a cyclist pumping his tire along the side of the road, and a full Jack in the Box meal, soggy and ruined by rain.</p>

<p><span class="time">9:38 a.m. </span><br />
The first Olympic distance athlete crosses the finish line in just under 2 hours. I, on the hand, still have about 8 miles to bike, and 6.2 miles to run.</p>

<p><span class="time">9:45 a.m. </span><br />
The number of riders on the road has thinned considerably; by now, most everyone is off his saddles and in her running shoes. Every now and then, a car drives by, fancy bike in tow. I imagine it carries another early finisher back towards wherever he or she came from, to resume his or her superhuman life.</p>

<p>To be honest, it feels a bit lonely. An older man passes me. His blue shirt flaps in the wind, exposing his lower back.</p>

<p><span class="time">10:09 a.m. </span><br />
24.8 miles later and some 100 minutes later, I’m back to the race site.</p>

<p><img class="hor-image" src="/assets/img/hits/bike.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="t2">Transition 2: Bike to Run</h2>
<p><span class="time">10:11 a.m. </span><br />
The end of the bike ride could not have come at a better time; I’m hungry and in need of a recharge. I catch my breath, scarf down two energy blocks and half an energy bar, and head out.</p>

<h2 id="run">Run</h2>
<p><span class="time">10:12 a.m. </span><br />
Most other competitors wear specialized biking shoes that clip onto their pedals. I’m much too lazy to buy them, so I biked in my running shoes. Drenched from the rain, they clop noisily with each step I take.</p>

<p><span class="time">10:13 a.m. </span><br />
During my bike ride, I was concerned that my legs would be dead. I’m only two minutes into the run, but it turns out they do have some juice left.</p>

<p><span class="time">10:20 a.m. </span><br />
I start passing other runners. They’re all much older than me.</p>

<p><span class="time">10:27 a.m. </span><br />
Someone yells my name. I look back towards the direction it came from. It belong to Lindsay Walker, who helped coordinate the event for LinkedIn employees. The shoutout givesme a boost, like I’m a Super Smash Brothers character who stumbles upon a mini heart.</p>

<p><span class="time">10:31 a.m. </span><br />
Prior to the triathlon, I never found running enjoyable — I always thought there was something sadistic about choosing to run long distances. However, I’m enjoying this run. In fact, the last 20 minutes have been my favorite part of the triathlon — which is now approaching the 3 hours mark. I’ve found my groove, and of course, it doesn’t hurt that the end is near.</p>

<p><span class="time">10:40 a.m. </span><br />
Halfway home. Volunteers shout encouragements. I grab an energy gel and slurp it down.</p>

<p><span class="time">11:02 a.m. </span><br />
I’m running on a bridge, the only flat portion of the run. The race site is just around the corner, so I work to pick up my speed.</p>

<p><span class="time">11:09 a.m. </span><br />
The words of Mr. Harvey, my high school physics teacher, implore me to “sprint to the finish!”</p>

<p><img class="hor-image" src="/assets/img/hits/finish.jpg" /></p>

<p><span class="time">11:10 a.m. </span><br />
Finished. All smiles.</p>

<h2 id="post-race">Post-Race</h2>
<p><span class="time">11:11 a.m. </span><br />
Time to eat! I feast on the post race spread, grabbing a bagel, an orange, two chocolate chip cookies, and some chips.</p>

<p><span class="time">3:23 p.m. </span><br />
Chicken karage, teryaki chicken with rice, and a roll of sushi at Joshuya, in Berkeley.</p>

<p><span class="time">4:03 p.m. </span><br />
Mint chocolate chip ice cream.</p>

<p><span class="time">4.04 p.m. </span><br />
Bliss.</p>
