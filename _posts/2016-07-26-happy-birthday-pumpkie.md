<div id="intro"><h2>Happy Birthday Pumpkie!</h2>

<p>We’ve stood atop the hills, gazing at the city beneath our feet. We’ve lay awake into the wee hours, garbling nonsense, rolling ourselves into burritos. We’ve woken up to a deep blue ocean blanketing the horizon, fallen asleep under stars that only the darkest of skies can reveal.</p>

<p>The world is full of new places; new corners, new worlds. But from Monterey Bay to Point Reyes, Belize to Crater Lake, we’ve done our fair share. </p>

<p>You’ll always be better at spoiling me with gifts, knowing what I want and need, ready at the perfect time. So instead of buying you a book of Japanese war songs from the late 19th century again, I wanted to make you something instead, something that’ll show how much of the world we’ve taken on — and how much we have still have yet to touch. </p>

<p>Together, hand in hand.</p>

<div id="glenCanyon">
<h2>Glen Canyon Park</h2>

<p>As the rest of the country watched the Super Bowl, we explored Glen Canyon and nearby Mt. Davidson. At Glen Canyon, we weaved through colorful trees and jagged rocks before an abandoned basketball court captured my imagination.</p>

<p>From the top of Mt. Davidson, we marveled at the metropolis below. We played around with a dead tree trunk, with branches radiating like the petals of a flower.</p>

<p>We meandered down residential roads back to the BART. To me, any sign of commotion had to be a Super Bowl Party  - and I made sure you knew by commenting out loud. "Oh, these guys are <i>definitely</i> watching."</p>

<p>By the third house, you were not amused.</p>

<div id="kayaking">
<h2>Kayaking at McCovey Cove</h2>

<p>
Thanks to your Groupon <strike>addiction</strike> foresight, we took to our second kayaking adventure, this time around McCovey Cove and Mission Bay.
</p>

<p>I was in charge of steering. As soon as we hit the water, I kept my foot on the left pedal when we needed to veer right. You yelled: "We're gonna crash!" </p>

<p>We paddled past a huge warship, the ballpark, the Willie Mays statue that we used to walk by as we first fell in love. We paddled next to the houseboats on Mission Bay, our old stomping grounds. On the way back we saw some sea lions feeding in the ocean, and fell behind the rest of the pack.</p>

<p>We made it back to land before the fever that consumed me for the next two days hit.</p>

<div id="loversLn">
<h2>Lover's Lane</h2>

<p>One of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Places-Francisco-That-Must-Miss/dp/3954516098">111 Places in San Francisco that we did not miss.</a></p>

<p>Our first time exploring the Presidio together. We walked along a twisting log that spiralled its way through a grove of eucalyptus trees. We made our way to El Polin Spring, dried out yet alive with remnants of the past.</p>  

<p>We walked by magnficient Presido mansions, stopping at the Lyon Street Steps as night fell upon the bay - a pleasant suprise. Diligient runners huffed and puffed up the steps, and a few tryhards carried weights as they ran. We opted for an Uber home.</p>

<p>Thank you for a being part of my favorite Sunday afternoons.</p>

<div id="goldenGate">
<h2>Golden Gate Park</h2> 

<p>We both worked from home, and around 3 p.m., we went for a bike ride through Golden Gate Park.</p>

<p>We stopped for a bit at the Consevatory of Flowers, where we a man berated a young couple for being too touchy. The man to the other side of us waxed poetic about burritos.</p>

<p>Classic San Francisco.</p>

<div id="goldenGateTapRoom">
<h2>Golden Gate Tap Room</h2>

<p>The first date.</p>

<p>I don't remember what we talked about. I remember asking you to sit next to me, rather than across from me. I think you asked, "is this what people on dates do?" We then became excited over the free appetizer that we got for checking in on Yelp.</p>

<p>We then played some games. You crushed me in foosball, so we walked home. I kissed you next to Union Square.</p>

<p>I miss those days.</p>
</div>

<div id="alcatraz">
<h2>Alcatraz</h2>

<p>My first visit to Alcatraz, for the night tour.</p>

<p>I had no idea the island is now a wildlife sanctuary, crammed to the last inch with birds making weird noises.</p> 

<p>We caught the end of the Ai Weiwei exhibit, and hustled to the top of the hill, where we gazed at the amazing night view of the city from the middle of the bay.</p>

<h2>Mt. Sutro Open Space Preserve</h2>
<p>Another of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Places-Francisco-That-Must-Miss/dp/3954516098">111 Places in San Francisco that we did not miss.</a></p>

<p>Mt. Sutro is an enclave away from the rest of the city. We walked peacefully along the trees and the mountain bikers.</p>

<p>We made it to nearby Tank Hill, where we took a selfie.</p>

<div id="coitTower">
<h2>Coit Tower</h2>

<p>I took you on one of my favorite walks from college, to visit Coit Tower at night. But first, we ate rectangular pizza at Golden Boy Pizza. I was quite pleased.</p>

<p>Whenever we found a place to take a quick break and sit, I would play music from my phone. We listened to a lot of Coldplay that night.</p>

<p>I remember making it down the steps and asking if you thought if we could make it all the way home by walking. "I guess we can try", you replied.</p>

<p>We made it about three blocks before I smartened up and called us a ride.</p>

</div>

<div id="moragaSteps">
<h2>16th Avenue & Moraga Steps</h2>
<p>One of our first trips exploring different parts of the city.</p>

<p>We made it to the Inner Sunset after work on Friday. This was back in my Robin Schulz phase, and I kept on singing the lyrics to the song 'Wilst Du' in my equally annoying and terrible German.</p>

<p>From the steps, we walked to Grand View Park - one of your favorite spots in the city. I had never seen the city from the West, never seen the ocean and the trees of Golden Gate Park from such heights.</p>

<p>We walked to Irving Street and ate at Marnee Thai restaurant - a small, smug space, and we were sitted next to two girls who talked about their social medial lives a little too loudly. We both laughed when they were moved away.</p>
